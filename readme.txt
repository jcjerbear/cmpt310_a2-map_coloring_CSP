1)run main.py with "python3.4 main.py" command in terminal on a CSIL machine
2)please run my code with Python3.0 or above
3)before running the python file, make sure you have testing data ready in "input.txt" file

data set in the "input.txt" file has to be in the following exmaple's format:
example 1 below is already given in the "input.txt" file
